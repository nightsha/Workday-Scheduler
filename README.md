# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

This project involved working with stater code to display past, present and
future activities listed in a scheduler to verify todos. A color scheme was also
employed to further emphasize the status of any activity. I was aided in this project
by my tutor Trinh and I also employed the use of ChatAI to help with some difficult
concepts when my tutor wasn't available.
